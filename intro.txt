- Who we are
- Been making sake for about a year and a half.

Overview
  - Start with a short introduction
  - Talk about ingredients
  - Show the process
  - Procedures are available with step-by-step details of our process

At the end of the presentation we'll be passing out samples of our sakes and a high-end commercial sake (junmai daiginjo).

We're all responsible drinkers here, so be aware that our sakes are genshu, that is, undiluted.  They are about 23-25% alcohol.

TODO: should we offer our breathalyzer?
