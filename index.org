#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Who we are
- Been making sake for about a year and a half.

Overview
  - Talk about ingredients
  - Show the process
  - Handouts are available with step-by-step details of our process
#TODO: modify process: compress layout, change back to single batch

At the end of the presentation we'll be passing out samples of our sakes and a high-end commercial sake (junmai daiginjo).

We're all responsible drinkers here, so be aware that our sakes are genshu, that is, undiluted.  They are about 23-25% alcohol.

TODO: should we offer our breathalyzer?

# * Introduction: Names for Sake
#
# #+BEGIN_NOTES
# Generally have to learn a little Japanese in order to learn sake making, so might as well start with the word "sake".
#
# Not called "sake" in Japan; it's called Nihonshu (Japanese alcohol) or more formally, seishu (clear alcohol).

# #+BEGIN_NOTES
# - Although usually described as "rice wine", sake is technically a beer
#   - Begins with grain, just like beer.
#   - No sugar in natural state, just like beer.
#   - Starches have to be converted to sugars for fermentation, just like beer.

* Ingredients: Rice

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- There are strains of rice bred specifically for sake (sakamai)
  - isn't used for eating, it's not very nutritious.
    - less protein, less fat

- The rice we've been using, though, is Calrose, a common foodstuff.
  - It's what we've found that's milled to at least 60%.

- Sources for milled rice:
  - nothing locally
  - Homebrewsake.com: 60% milled Calrose rice: $24/10lb bag (+s/h)
  - F.H. Steinbart: 48-61% milled Calrose rice: $20/10lb bag (+s/h)

* Ingredients: Rice

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Rice needs to be milled, or polished, for high quality sake
  - at least 70%, 60% is much better, 50% is considered best
- Milled (polished) to remove outer layers of the grain
  - fiber
  - protein
  - lipids
- Less protein makes the taste of sake crisp and light
- Less fat makes sake more flavorful

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- There is no extract brewing or partial mash for sake making, it's all grain or nothing.
- But there is a way to start simpler and save time, effort, and money: buy koji.
  - legitimate: most sake breweries buy it from specialists
# - I'm going to describe koji making at the end
#   - koji making is the most complex part of sake making
#   - koji making is easier to understand after learning basic sake making
- Not going to describe milling and koji making

- Safety Tip: sake can be *very* slippery, beware when handling glass

- Beer: fairly "hands-off" process; the wort is protected, not touched, not exposed to air, etc.  Mostly left alone.
- Sake: very "hands-on" process; fermentor isn't sealed, opened up and stirred often, rice processing involves lots of touching, stirring, etc.  Shibori, squeeze with hands.

  - vitamins (enriched)

Don't overdo the washing.
Be very gentle with the rice.
#+END_NOTES

* Shubo / Moto: Soak the Rice

#+BEGIN_NOTES
We want to raise the water content of the rice up to 25-35%.
  - milled 60%: soak for an hour
  - table rice: soak for two hours

Sake breweries will use a stopwatch to time soaking.
  - We don't need to be that precise.

Tip: invest in a mixing bowl slightly bigger than your rice washer.

#+BEGIN_NOTES

* Shubo / Moto: Drain the Rice

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I don't know why we do this step.

This is where the yeast is added to the moto water.
#+END_NOTES

#+REVEAL_HTML: <video data-autoplay src="moto-drain-rice.webm"></video>

* Shubo / Moto: Steam the Rice

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Tip: use distilled water in your steamer, prevents scaling

Tip: fill with more water than you'll need, don't let the steamer run dry, you can funnel unused water back into jugs

Tip: cover steamer base with lid to heat water up quicker

Tip: use grade 90 cheesecloth (butter muslin) for steaming rice -- the rice doesn't stick to it.

Tip: use your hands to spread and pack the rice in the steamer

Rice must be steamed to gelatinize the starches.  Gelatinizing alters the structure of the starch (more soluble), which in turn allows the enzymes provided by the koji to work their magic.

Very important to steam, rather than boil or simmer, the rice.  Steamed rice, when fully gelatinized, doesn't have the tendency to go mushy and gooey like normally cooked rice does.

Cooking rice forces a lot more water into the rice than steaming.  This compromises the rice grains' ability to hold any kind of structure.  The koji will reduce the rice to to goo and won't have a good home.

This is where the koji is added to the moto water.
#+END_NOTES

#+REVEAL_HTML: <video data-autoplay src="moto-steam-rice.webm"></video>

* Shubo / Moto: Test the Rice

#+BEGIN_NOTES
We use a small, cheap microscope to check the rice.  But just biting into a few rice kernels is very effective, too.
#+END_NOTES

#+REVEAL_HTML: <video data-autoplay src="moto-test-rice.webm"></video>

* Shubo / Moto: Cool the Rice

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This can take a long time if you aren't prepared to cool the rice quickly.

This is why we froze part of the moto water earlier.

You can put the rice in a freezer to cool it quicker.

You can spread the rice into a thin layer to cool it quicker.
#+END_NOTES

#+REVEAL_HTML: <video data-autoplay src="moto-cool-rice.webm"></video>

* Shubo / Moto: Add the Rice

#+BEGIN_NOTES
The moto at this stage will be fairly dry, but the koji and yeast will liquify it.

After this, put the moto into the fermentation fridge.
#+END_NOTES

#+REVEAL_HTML: <video data-autoplay src="moto-add-rice.webm"></video>

* Shubo / Moto: Fermentation

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Stir every 12 hours
- Control the temperature
  - Book says 65-72 F

- Starts with no sugars, and the koji slowly, steadily produces amylase to convert starches into sugars
  - This is an ideal environment for yeast
  - Allows the yeast to get up to 22-25% alcohol
  - This is what gives sake its unique flavor

- Use a technique that makes use of both hydrometer and refractometer readings from only the final product to determine percent alcohol.

#
# #+BEGIN_NOTES
# - measure out into baggies to prevent errors
# #+END_NOTES
#
# * Future Experiments
#
# - skip the draining step for all rice preparation
# - use stir plate to stir the moto and moromi when liquid enough
# - or, stir for less time (1 minute instead of 5)
#   - At least for the moto
# - tap water instead of bottled spring water
# - tap water instead of bottled distilled water + added minerals
# - different rice strains (now that we have a rice mill)
# - add brewer's alcohol before shibori
#   - supposed to release more flavor from the mash
# - normalize addition proportions
#   - 12.5%, 12.5%, 25%, 50% of all ingredients
# - use anti-foam drops to control foaming
# - use a mix-stir before shibori to break up rice kernels
